I have been going a little sticker-crazy lately, and I decided I wanted a "Fork Me" sticker, ala GitHub's [Fork Me ribbons][github-ribbons] (pro-tip: use [these retina-friendly ones instead][retina-ribbons]) that are common for OSS developers to put onto their websites or their project websites. I couldn't find one anywhere, so I made one, and now you too can emblazon your favorite things with a "Fork Me" ribbon sticker.
