Taffy has changed a fair amount, and for the better, since its release 2.5 years ago. It's also now used in production on Adobe ColdFusion and Railo every day of the year. It's baked into Slatwall, the open source eCommerce plugin for Mura. It's used by an augmented reality iPhone application to send data and photos between phones and servers.

And still, it's the easiest, fastest way to get the job done from a CFML platform; and I'd like to help you get started writing API's today.

This session will teach you the basics of REST, as well as everything you need to know to get started writing REST API's with Taffy. From "what's an HTTP verb?" to Dependency Injection, to Uploading Files, and everywhere in between. We'll also cover adding an API to an existing application because as we all know, starting from scratch is not often a privilege of which we get the pleasure.
