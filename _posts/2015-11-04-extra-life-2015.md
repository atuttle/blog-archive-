I know this is terribly last minute, but I've been swamped with deadlines and such and haven't had any time to actively hype my Extra Life campaign this year. _And it's happening this weekend!_

Starting at 8pm on Saturday, November 7th (US-Eastern) I'll begin a 24 hour marathon of games of all types. Video games, Board games, card games, dice games. Maybe even some other tabletop gaming if I can arrange some friends to get together in time. And I won't stop playing, except to eat or go to the bathroom, for 24 hours. No time-outs. No tag-ins.

For the uninitiated, [Extra Life][extralife] is a charity that collects money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, whose mission is to provide care for children, regardless of their family's ability to pay for it.

Kids with cancer, or heart issues, or that were in car accidents. The list goes on and on and on.

They deserve our support and our help! And they're in my back yard. I play for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), but there are CMN Hospitals all over the world. There's probably one near you too.

## What I'm doing for your money

How does it work? Well, I usually compare it to the ACS Relay For Life, except instead of walking in circles for 24 hours we're playing games &mdash; of all varieties. The header image is of my brothers and I (and my son) playing some Rock Band during my 2013 marathon. Video games are a big part of it for most people, but I usually try to get my whole family involved by playing board and card games too.

Just like Relay for Life, it all hinges on soliciting donations from friends. _**Friends like you**._ Would you be so kind as to donate a few dollars to help sick kids? I'm attempting to raise $1,024 this year, and I could really use your help. I greatly appreciate every donation, no matter how small; but more importantly, it goes directly to helping sick kids get the medical care that they need.
