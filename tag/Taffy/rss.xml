<p>Taffy has changed a fair amount, and for the better, since its release 2.5 years ago. It&#39;s also now used in production on Adobe ColdFusion and Railo every day of the year. It&#39;s baked into Slatwall, the open source eCommerce plugin for Mura. It&#39;s used by an augmented reality iPhone application to send data and photos between phones and servers.</p>

<p>And still, it&#39;s the easiest, fastest way to get the job done from a CFML platform; and I&#39;d like to help you get started writing API&#39;s today.</p>

<p>This session will teach you the basics of REST, as well as everything you need to know to get started writing REST API&#39;s with Taffy. From &quot;what&#39;s an HTTP verb?&quot; to Dependency Injection, to Uploading Files, and everywhere in between. We&#39;ll also cover adding an API to an existing application because as we all know, starting from scratch is not often a privilege of which we get the pleasure.</p>
