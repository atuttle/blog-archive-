	     <p>In what I hope is the first in a long series of short posts describing small steps I&#39;m taking to <em>do the right thing&trade;</em>, today I want to talk about eliminating <em>yet another email notification</em>. In a way I guess you could say I&#39;m on a campaign against email, at least as a method of anything other than async remote communication.</p>

<p>Back in the dark ages of 2013 I gave a conference presentation on an open source tool that I use called <a href="http://www.bugloghq.com/">BugLogHQ</a>, an alternative to sending yourself emails containing debug information when an exception occurs in your app &ndash; and I hasten to reiterate: one with many advantages. My team and I still use BLHQ to this day, and it is remarkably better than emailing error debug information. <a href="/errors-are-best-when-emailed-said-nobody-ever/">You can see the conference session abstract and the slides here</a>. Not as good as being there, but it should give you an idea of how great BLHQ can be, comparatively.</p>

<p>Having solved the error logging problem, the next thing that shows up in my email occasionally, ripe for disruption, is <em>success notifications</em> for scheduled jobs like database backups, and membership expiration reminders. What these types of notifications need is not a success notification, but a failure notification. Hopefully error logging catches any errors that occur during those jobs, but what happens if the cron job gets disabled?</p>

<p><em>Will you notice that you didn&#39;t get that email last night when the backups should have run?</em></p>

<p>What you really need in this situation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch">dead man&#39;s switch</a>. These take many forms, but at their simplest you can think of them as a grenade with the pin removed. If you loosen your grip and the &quot;spoon&quot; is released from the grenade ... boom. In digital form, releasing the spoon would be your scheduled job missing a &quot;check in,&quot; and the boom would be a notification that your job hasn&#39;t run on schedule.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://deadmanssnitch.com/r/228ab4a26f">Dead Man&#39;s Snitch</a>. This app actually started out as a side project for a local Philly entrepreneur and aquiantance of mine; and I like to support local businesses, especially when they&#39;re awesome. DMS is a web service that your job calls to &quot;check in&quot; via a simple HTTP GET request. Miss a check in and they&#39;ll let you know. There are a bunch of different schedules available, and at varying price levels you get access to different integrations (i.e. Slack).</p>

<p>There are a few nuances that I&#39;m leaving out to keep this simple, so if you&#39;re interested or just have questions, go <a href="https://deadmanssnitch.com/r/228ab4a26f">check out the site</a> for more information. And hey, maybe give the service a shot: you get 1 snitch for free into perpetuity, so why not?</p>

<p><small><em>Disclosure: The links in this post, while not a paid advertisement, are referral links. If you sign up for an account then I get a free snitch for my account. Obviously I think the service is pretty great: I have a paid account for personal use as well as a paid account for my business; and I&#39;m hoping you will sign up too. But if referral links just aren&#39;t your thing, <a href="https://deadmanssnitch.com/">here&#39;s a clean one</a>.</em></small></p>
