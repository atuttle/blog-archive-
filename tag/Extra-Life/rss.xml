	     <p>I know this is terribly last minute, but I&#39;ve been swamped with deadlines and such and haven&#39;t had any time to actively hype my Extra Life campaign this year. <em>And it&#39;s happening this weekend!</em></p>

<p>Starting at 8pm on Saturday, November 7th (US-Eastern) I&#39;ll begin a 24 hour marathon of games of all types. Video games, Board games, card games, dice games. Maybe even some other tabletop gaming if I can arrange some friends to get together in time. And I won&#39;t stop playing, except to eat or go to the bathroom, for 24 hours. No time-outs. No tag-ins.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/">Extra Life</a> is a charity that collects money for Children&#39;s Miracle Network Hospitals, whose mission is to provide care for children, regardless of their families ability to pay for it.</p>

<p>Kids with cancer, or heart issues, or that were in car accidents. The list goes on and on and on.</p>

<p>They deserve our support and our help! And they&#39;re in my back yard. I play for the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), but there are CMN Hospitals all over the world. There&#39;s probably one near you too.</p>

<h2>What I&#39;m doing for your money</h2>

<p>How does it work? Well, I usually compare it to the ACS Relay For Life, except instead of walking in circles for 24 hours we&#39;re playing games &mdash; of all varieties. The header image is of my brothers and I (and my son) playing some Rock Band during my 2013 marathon. Video games are a big part of it for most people, but I usually try to get my whole family involved by playing board and card games too.</p>

<p>Just like Relay for Life, it all hinges on soliciting donations from friends. <em><strong>Friends like you</strong>.</em> Would you be so kind as to donate a few dollars to help sick kids? I&#39;m attempting to raise $1,024 this year, and I could really use your help. I greatly appreciate every donation, no matter how small; but more importantly, it goes directly to helping sick kids get the medical care that they need.</p>

<p>What do you say? Let&#39;s help some kids!</p>
