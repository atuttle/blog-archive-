	     <p>Just shy of two weeks ago I completed my 100th skydive, which was a huge accomplishment for me. It took me around 18 months to collect that many (not counting the 15 year layoff between jumps #1 and #2).</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some sort of brag: 100 is only a drop in the bucket in the average skydiving career. People that work in the sport can get thousands of jumps in a year. Most active hobbyist jumpers these days don&#39;t have much trouble getting 100+ in a year; and in fact I&#39;m hoping to come close to that for calendar year 2016, but for {reasons} I am not able to jump as often as I&#39;d like. Also, there are additional restrictions while you&#39;re a student, which I was from May (#2) to August 2014 (#25), resulting in reduced jump numbers.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest: I&#39;d jump twenty times every day if I could, so there&#39;s probably no reasonable amount that will satisfy the &quot;as much as I&#39;d like&quot; criteria.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a compilation of some of the video from my first 100 jumps.</p>

<p>Jump #100 is not included in the compilation because nobody on the jump had a camera. C&#39;est la vie.</p>

<p>For those of you wondering, in the USA you&#39;re not allowed to wear a camera until around 200 jumps. There are more rules and it gets more technical than that, but we&#39;ll just leave it at: wearing a camera is something I still have to look forward to, not something I can do yet.</p>
