    <description>It's one thing to write code. It's another to humanize technology so it serves a purpose in people's lives. &amp;mdash; Luke Wroblewski</description>

      <title>Three Reasons We Went Solar (and You Should Too!)</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/three-reasons-we-went-solar-and-you-should-too/</link>
      <description>Last June, I called my buddy Mike and told him I wanted to go solar. We were about to move into our new house and I wanted him to look at the roof on Google Maps to confirm it would be worth installing solar panels. At the time he was a salesman (he's since been promoted) for [Solar City][ref], and I know he'll always be honest with me even when he's trying to sell me something.

      <description>I know this is terribly last minute, but I've been swamped with deadlines and such and haven't had any time to actively hype my Extra Life campaign this year. _And it's happening this weekend!_

      <title>On Old Dogs and New Tricks</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/on-old-dogs-and-new-tricks/</link>
      <description>Consider the following code. This isn't an exercise in figuring out what something does, or how to do it, so I'll just tell you: it updates a list of items (e.g. user input) so that all items in the list are quoted with single-quotes. If it finds them, it strips out double quotes, too (only if both open and close quotes exist).
