    <description>It's one thing to write code. It's another to humanize technology so it serves a purpose in people's lives. &amp;mdash; Luke Wroblewski</description>

      <title>Expose Node.js on an IIS Server by Reverse Proxying With ARR</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/add-node-to-existing-iis-server/</link>
      <description>Here's something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time now: I have a Windows server, running IIS and a dozen or so websites on various technologies like PHP, CFML, and ASP.NET. I'd like to add node.js support to that mix without disrupting any of the existing websites.

      <title>My First 100 Jumps</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/my-first-100-jumps/</link>
      <description>Just shy of two weeks ago I completed my 100th skydive, which was a huge accomplishment for me. It took me around 18 months to collect that many (not counting the 15 year layoff between jumps #1 and #2).

      <title>Modern Cache Busting for the Platforms of Yesteryear</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/modern-cache-busting-for-the-platforms-of-yeasteryear/</link>
      <description>If you work with a platform born in the last 5-10 years, chances are pretty good you've got something like the [Rails asset pipeline][rap] to take care of stuff like this for you. But if your platform of choice (or in my case this time... platform of consequence) doesn't handle it for you, you may be wondering how best to integrate cache busting into your application.

      <title>Three Reasons We Went Solar (and You Should Too!)</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/three-reasons-we-went-solar-and-you-should-too/</link>
      <description>Last June, I called my buddy Mike and told him I wanted to go solar. We were about to move into our new house and I wanted him to look at the roof on Google Maps to confirm it would be worth installing solar panels. At the time he was a salesman (he's since been promoted) for [Solar City][ref], and I know he'll always be honest with me even when he's trying to sell me something.

      <description>I know this is terribly last minute, but I've been swamped with deadlines and such and haven't had any time to actively hype my Extra Life campaign this year. _And it's happening this weekend!_

      <title>On Old Dogs and New Tricks</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/on-old-dogs-and-new-tricks/</link>
      <description>Consider the following code. This isn't an exercise in figuring out what something does, or how to do it, so I'll just tell you: it updates a list of items (e.g. user input) so that all items in the list are quoted with single-quotes. If it finds them, it strips out double quotes, too (only if both open and close quotes exist).
