      <title>TIL: Adding an SSL Cert to the JVM Inside a Docker Image</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/TIL-adding-a-jvm-ssl-cert-docker/</link>
      <description>I've been playing with Docker lately for a bunch of reasons, but topping that list is that it's everything I ever wanted out of Vagrant, and then some. (And what better thing to do on a camping trip after the kids are tucked into bed?) In some ways, the Dockerfile syntax is what I wish the Vagrantfile syntax was (shell script instead of Ruby). Anyway, here's a solution to an interesting problem I ran into today.

      <title>Cobbler's Children Syndrome</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/cobblers-children-syndrome/</link>
      <description>My old blog at [fusiongrokker.com](http://fusiongrokker.com) was recently offline for more than 230 consecutive hours. Partly, the hosting company is to blame for this. I pay them for a service: A server, connected to the internet, with electricity; and this service was not being properly provided. But partly it is my own fault too.

      <title>&quot;Fork Me on GitHub&quot; Stickers</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/fork-me-stickers/</link>
      <description>I have been going a little sticker-crazy lately, and I decided I wanted a &quot;Fork Me&quot; sticker, ala GitHub's [Fork Me ribbons][github-ribbons] (pro-tip: use [these retina-friendly ones instead][retina-ribbons]) that are common for OSS developers to put onto their websites or their project websites. I couldn't find one anywhere, so I made one, and now you too can emblazon your favorite things with a &quot;Fork Me&quot; ribbon sticker.

      <title>The Right Tool for the Job: Success Notifications</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/the-right-tool-success-notifications/</link>
      <description>In what I hope is the first in a long series of short posts describing small steps I'm taking to _do the right thing&amp;trade;_, today I want to talk about eliminating _yet another email notification_. In a way I guess you could say I'm on a campaign against email, at least as a method of anything other than async remote communication.

      <description>Recently a friend told me that he had switched to a Mac full time and asked if I had any advice for software, or just in terms of general usage. I would have swarn that I already had a blog post on the topic that I wanted to link to him (outdated though it may be), but try as I might I couldn't find it. So here we go, I'm starting from scratch!

      <title>Expose Node.js on an IIS Server by Reverse Proxying With ARR</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/add-node-to-existing-iis-server/</link>
      <description>Here's something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time now: I have a Windows server, running IIS and a dozen or so websites on various technologies like PHP, CFML, and ASP.NET. I'd like to add node.js support to that mix without disrupting any of the existing websites.

      <title>My First 100 Jumps</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/my-first-100-jumps/</link>
      <description>Just shy of two weeks ago I completed my 100th skydive, which was a huge accomplishment for me. It took me around 18 months to collect that many (not counting the 15 year layoff between jumps #1 and #2).

      <title>Modern Cache Busting for the Platforms of Yesteryear</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/modern-cache-busting-for-the-platforms-of-yeasteryear/</link>
      <description>If you work with a platform born in the last 5-10 years, chances are pretty good you've got something like the [Rails asset pipeline][rap] to take care of stuff like this for you. But if your platform of choice (or in my case this time... platform of consequence) doesn't handle it for you, you may be wondering how best to integrate cache busting into your application.

      <title>Three Reasons We Went Solar (and You Should Too!)</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/three-reasons-we-went-solar-and-you-should-too/</link>
      <description>Last June, I called my buddy Mike and told him I wanted to go solar. We were about to move into our new house and I wanted him to look at the roof on Google Maps to confirm it would be worth installing solar panels. At the time he was a salesman (he's since been promoted) for [Solar City][ref], and I know he'll always be honest with me even when he's trying to sell me something.

      <title>On Old Dogs and New Tricks</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/on-old-dogs-and-new-tricks/</link>
      <description>Consider the following code. This isn't an exercise in figuring out what something does, or how to do it, so I'll just tell you: it updates a list of items (e.g. user input) so that all items in the list are quoted with single-quotes. If it finds them, it strips out double quotes, too (only if both open and close quotes exist).
