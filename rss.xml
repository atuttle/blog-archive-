      <title>Adding SSH Passphrase to Your Keychain on macOS Sierra</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/Adding-SSH-passphrase-to-keychain-on-macOS-Sierra/</link>
      <description>The truth is that I just don't have anywhere better to jot this down for my own future reference, so I'm inflicting it on the world as another blog post. I guess it could prove helpful to some people too, so there's that.

      <description>It is that time of year again! Time for me to beg you for donations to, in my opinion, one of the most honorable causes there is: The wellbeing of children.

      <title>The Cost of Abstraction</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/the-cost-of-abstraction/</link>
      <description>Earlier today a friend and colleague who is almost 40 sent me a link to this article: [Reflections of an &quot;Old&quot; Programmer][old]. I'm 34, so still a few years shy of Ben, but I have been starting to get the feeling that I'm an &quot;old&quot; coder too. So hopefully my thoughts in response aren't too far off-base.

      <title>Giggle Driven Development</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/giggle-driven-development/</link>
      <description>Yesterday morning while spending time with my kids before they left for school, and completely by accident, I found myself on a website making use of some really neat technology that made programming problems and lego-block style &quot;coding&quot; of solutions really novel, simple, and approachable. We had a bunch of fun working on some of the problems together, and I feel compelled to share.

      <description>This is going to be more field-notes than how-to, but when I tweeted about how I had such an easy experience getting some Docker containers running in production I had several people express interest in reading about my experiences, so here we are.

      <description>There are a few moments in my life where I feel like I have truly grown as a person. Usually when I learn something profound and it sinks in immediately, and it's like a lightbulb has lit up over my head. I can think of at least two such moments that happened when I re-watched The West Wing early this year.

      <title>TIL: Adding an SSL Cert to the JVM Inside a Docker Image</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/TIL-adding-a-jvm-ssl-cert-docker/</link>
      <description>I've been playing with Docker lately for a bunch of reasons, but topping that list is that it's everything I ever wanted out of Vagrant, and then some. (And what better thing to do on a camping trip after the kids are tucked into bed?) In some ways, the Dockerfile syntax is what I wish the Vagrantfile syntax was (shell script instead of Ruby). Anyway, here's a solution to an interesting problem I ran into today.

      <title>Cobbler's Children Syndrome</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/cobblers-children-syndrome/</link>
      <description>My old blog at [fusiongrokker.com](http://fusiongrokker.com) was recently offline for more than 230 consecutive hours. Partly, the hosting company is to blame for this. I pay them for a service: A server, connected to the internet, with electricity; and this service was not being properly provided. But partly it is my own fault too.

      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/fork-me-stickers/</link>
      <description>I have been going a little sticker-crazy lately, and I decided I wanted a &quot;Fork Me&quot; sticker, ala GitHub's [Fork Me ribbons][github-ribbons] (pro-tip: use [these retina-friendly ones instead][retina-ribbons]) that are common for OSS developers to put onto their websites or their project websites. I couldn't find one anywhere, so I made one, and now you too can emblazon your favorite things with a &quot;Fork Me&quot; ribbon sticker.

      <title>The Right Tool for the Job: Success Notifications</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/the-right-tool-success-notifications/</link>
      <description>In what I hope is the first in a long series of short posts describing small steps I'm taking to _do the right thing&amp;trade;_, today I want to talk about eliminating _yet another email notification_. In a way I guess you could say I'm on a campaign against email, at least as a method of anything other than async remote communication.

      <description>Recently a friend told me that he had switched to a Mac full time and asked if I had any advice for software, or just in terms of general usage. I would have swarn that I already had a blog post on the topic that I wanted to link to him (outdated though it may be), but try as I might I couldn't find it. So here we go, I'm starting from scratch!

      <description>Here's something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time now: I have a Windows server, running IIS and a dozen or so websites on various technologies like PHP, CFML, and ASP.NET. I'd like to add node.js support to that mix without disrupting any of the existing websites.

      <description>Just shy of two weeks ago I completed my 100th skydive, which was a huge accomplishment for me. It took me around 18 months to collect that many (not counting the 15 year layoff between jumps #1 and #2).

      <title>Modern Cache Busting for the Platforms of Yesteryear</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/modern-cache-busting-for-the-platforms-of-yeasteryear/</link>
      <description>If you work with a platform born in the last 5-10 years, chances are pretty good you've got something like the [Rails asset pipeline][rap] to take care of stuff like this for you. But if your platform of choice (or in my case this time... platform of consequence) doesn't handle it for you, you may be wondering how best to integrate cache busting into your application.

      <title>Three Reasons We Went Solar (and You Should Too!)</title>
      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/three-reasons-we-went-solar-and-you-should-too/</link>
      <description>Last June, I called my buddy Mike and told him I wanted to go solar. We were about to move into our new house and I wanted him to look at the roof on Google Maps to confirm it would be worth installing solar panels. At the time he was a salesman (he's since been promoted) for [Solar City][ref], and I know he'll always be honest with me even when he's trying to sell me something.

      <link>http://adamtuttle.codes/on-old-dogs-and-new-tricks/</link>
      <description>Consider the following code. This isn't an exercise in figuring out what something does, or how to do it, so I'll just tell you: it updates a list of items (e.g. user input) so that all items in the list are quoted with single-quotes. If it finds them, it strips out double quotes, too (only if both open and close quotes exist).
