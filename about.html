            <p>Adam Tuttle is a coder, thinker, tweeter, and dad from just outside Philadelphia, PA, USA. As CTO and Lead Engineer for <a href="http://www.alumniq.com">AlumnIQ</a> he is responsible for shaping and building technology that aims to revolutionize Higher Education Advancement and Alumni Relations. He&#39;s also a skydiving bum trapped in a working man&#39;s body.</p>

<p>He wishes that modern American culture didn&#39;t make it necessary to say this, but here it is anyway: <em>Opinions expressed on this blog are those of the author, and the author alone.</em></p>

<h3>Life Story, abridged version</h3>

<p>I&#39;m Adam. I work for <a href="http://www.alumniq.com">AlumnIQ</a> (formerly CounterMarch Systems), and work from home full time on a geographically distributed, 100% remote team. I live near Philadelphia, PA, USA. I make web and mobile stuff... Mostly I make the AlumnIQ family of products, but we do <em>a lot of things</em> in the Higher Education space.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m not behind a keyboard, I enjoy skydiving, snowboarding, traveling, board games and video games, camping, hiking, canoeing, and fishing. My wife and I have two children, a dog, a cat, and a small collection of hermit crabs.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived on all three US coasts, and briefly in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@38.6903073,-27.9664891,8.98z">The Azores</a>, Portugal. I got my first computer when I was nine years old, circa 1990. When Windows 3.11 was released in 1992, my dad got me a 486-66 and set it up to play a clip of the Pink Floyd song <em>Welcome to the Machine</em> so that it sang &quot;Welcome my son. Welcome... to... the machine&quot; as it was booting. (Somehow a 5 minute boot didn&#39;t seem so slow back then.) I was doomed. From that point on, computers became the focus of my life.</p>

<p>I learned software development by teaching myself Visual Basic from a few books when I was around 12 years old and have never stopped coding. Between school, work, and hobby, I&#39;ve had occasion to dabble in C/C++, Java/JSP, Perl, Natural, PHP, Python, and Ruby. These days my bread and butter are JavaScript, CFML, HTML, and LESS/CSS. I&#39;ve had various computer-related jobs, running the gamut from server sales, colocation and management, ISP Sales &amp; Support, LAN and WAN tech support, and eventually landing at software development using ColdFusion 4.5; right around the same time I was taking my first programming courses in High School.</p>

<p>During my senior year of college I did a one year internship at <a href="http://www.perdue.com/">Perdue Farms</a>, and then worked there for a year full time after graduation, programming in a mainframe environment. After the &quot;big company&quot; experience I decided that I would be happier working for a smaller, more progressive company that was willing to ride a little closer to the bleeding edge of technology; and I found myself at E-Tech Solutions, based in West Chester, PA. I worked there for a year and a half before we were acquired by <a href="https://www.perficient.com/">Perficient</a>, where I worked for another year and a half before the itch to change things around flared up again. After that I worked at <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton Computing&#39;s Learning Lab</a> for almost exactly 3 years, developing and maintaining business simulations and serious games.</p>

<p>Then I got an offer I couldn&#39;t refuse, and now I find myself working from home full time, with some of my best friends, doing stuff that I love. If this isn&#39;t a dream job, I don&#39;t know what is.</p>
