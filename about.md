### Life Story, abridged version

I'm Adam. I work for [AlumnIQ][iq] (formerly CounterMarch Systems), and work from home full time on a geographically distributed, 100% remote team. I live near Philadelphia, PA, USA. I make web and mobile stuff... Mostly I make the AlumnIQ family of products, but we do _a lot of things_ in the Higher Education space.

When I'm not behind a keyboard, I enjoy skydiving, snowboarding, traveling, board games and video games, camping, hiking, canoeing, and fishing. My wife and I have two children, a dog, a cat, and a small collection of hermit crabs.

I've lived on all three US coasts, and briefly in [The Azores][azores], Portugal. I got my first computer when I was nine years old, circa 1990. When Windows 3.11 was released in 1992, my dad got me a 486-66 and set it up to play a clip of the Pink Floyd song _Welcome to the Machine_ so that it sang "Welcome my son. Welcome... to... the machine" as it was booting. (Somehow a 5 minute boot didn't seem so slow back then.) I was doomed. From that point on, computers became the focus of my life.

I learned software development by teaching myself Visual Basic from a few books when I was around 12 years old and have never stopped coding. Between school, work, and hobby, I've had occasion to dabble in C/C++, Java/JSP, Perl, Natural, PHP, Python, and Ruby. These days my bread and butter are JavaScript, CFML, HTML, and LESS/CSS. I've had various computer-related jobs, running the gamut from server sales, colocation and management, ISP Sales & Support, LAN and WAN tech support, and eventually landing at software development using ColdFusion 4.5; right around the same time I was taking my first programming courses in High School.

During my senior year of college I did a one year internship at [Perdue Farms][perdue], and then worked there for a year full time after graduation, programming in a mainframe environment. After the "big company" experience I decided that I would be happier working for a smaller, more progressive company that was willing to ride a little closer to the bleeding edge of technology; and I found myself at E-Tech Solutions, based in West Chester, PA. I worked there for a year and a half before we were acquired by [Perficient][perficient], where I worked for another year and a half before the itch to change things around flared up again. After that I worked at [Wharton Computing's Learning Lab][LL] for almost exactly 3 years, developing and maintaining business simulations and serious games.

Then I got an offer I couldn't refuse, and now I find myself working from home full time, with some of my best friends, doing stuff that I love. If this isn't a dream job, I don't know what is.
