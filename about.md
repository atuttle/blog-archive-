I'm a coder, systems thinker, speaker, human interface designer &mdash; and fortunately enough, temporary collection of stardust in the approximate shape of a human being &mdash; living in the suburbs of the suburbs (that's not a typo) of Philadelphia, PA.

You can connect with me [on GitHub][gh], [on Twitter][tw], [on YouTube][yt], and [on GoodReads][gr].

I joined [AlumnIQ][iq] as employee #2 in 2012, where I have become the CTO and Lead developer, shaping and building technology that aims to revolutionize Higher Education Advancement and Alumni Relations. In my time here, I've helped grow the company from two people to _**three**_. (I hope to be able to update that with a more impressive number as time goes on.)

I work from home on a geographically distributed, 100% remote team, which means I get the privilege of making breakfast and lunch 3+ days a week for my two children. I have a strange addiction to collecting board games even though we don't play them very much. I make some pretty killer pizza from scratch, if I do say so myself.

I'm also a skydiving bum trapped in a working man's body.

I love traveling, whether it be to attend or speak at an event, or vacationing. I've lived on all three Continental American coasts, and [The Azores][azores]. My dog is named after a character from Futurama. I've called 911 in emergency situations twice in my life. One of them was for my brother. I swam a mile, camped in deep snow, hiked some parts of the Appalachain Trail and different parts of Redwood National and State Parks. I've never been to the Grand Canyon. I remember attending 6 different schools up to and including high school, but it might have been more. I can tie a bowline knot with one hand. My favorite author is Bill Bryson, but paradoxically my favorite book genre is science fiction.

Speaking of books, I wrote and self-published [a book about designing REST APIs pragmatically][restassured] &mdash; and I did it over the course of two weeks, after work. If you use or build APIs, it would probably interest you. You can read the first chapter for free, and if you decide not to buy it we can still be friends.

Want to chat? [Email me][email]. Or ask on my AMA ([Ask Me Anything][ama]), if it's something others might be interested to read. I am also available to hire on an ad-hoc basis [for mentoring on coding and other topics][mentor].
