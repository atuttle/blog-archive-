If I had a single over-arching life philosophy it would be, "Make the most of what you've got." It doesn't take me long to make a decision, because I can just spend a couple of minutes weighing my options and then go with my gut and make the most of the situation I've put myself into.

Along the same line, I've never thought of myself as afflicted. I don't let it define who I am or how I live my life. But it's true: I need significant medical care on a regular and frequent basis to maintain even a decent quality of life.

I have [Ankylosing Spondylitis][as], a sort of cousin to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and based on what I've read online from others with AS, I am fortunate enough to have a fairly mild case. Yet, if I rest on my knees on the ground for a few minutes to change the tire on my truck, or do an extreme amount of physical labor with my hands (carrying furniture while moving comes to mind), then I will pay for it in the days and weeks following in the form of pain, swelling, inflamation, and soreness. It affects most of my joints, but my knees, hips, lower back, and hands get it the worst.

**And that's while I'm receiving treatments regularly.**

I get an I.V. infusion of [Remicade][remicade] every 6 weeks. My current dosage costs about $7,700 USD per visit -- just for the drug. That doesn't include the doctor's office / administrative fees. That's more than $66,000 per year for medicine.

I've been getting Remicade since August 2008, and my current insurance company, **Aetna, has now decided to stop paying for it** for &ndash;as we'll see&ndash; terrible beaurocratic reasons.

### A Stressful but Usable System

Because of the extreme cost of my needs, the insurance plan that works best for myself and my family is actually two plans. I work for a company so small that we don't yet qualify for group insurance, which means I have to fend for myself on the marketplace. I started with [AlumnIQ][iq] about 18 months before the marketplace opened, so I am speaking from experience when I say that the marketplace, and by extension The Affordable Care Act ("ACA" or "Obamacare") has been a blessing. Insurance companies are still scoundrels seeking to make the largest possible profit at the expense of doctors and patients; but at least they've had to standardize how their plans are described and put all of the information in one place that makes it easy(er) to compare them.

My wife and children are on a typical plan where we're trying to balance what we pay in premiums, deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance; resulting in always wondering when it's the right time to go to the doctor. It's not important to the following story or this post in general, but in the interest of full disclosure, their plan is _not_ with Aetna.

For example about a month ago, after returning from a camping trip, my youngest son was complaining a lot about soreness in his legs and generally more whiny than usual, but we attributed it to him being 5 years old and not wanting to cooperate when asked to do something, as 5 year olds often do. He was also kind of red around the eyes, but we attributed that to seasonal allergies. That night I gave him a bath and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

![My son with a red rash around his eyes. We soon learned that this was an early warning sign of lyme disease.][red-eyes]

The next morning, he was complaining about an itchy red spot on his arm. It didn't seem like an obvious "bullseye" shaped rash at the time, but we _had_ just been camping so we were worried about ticks and lyme anyway.

![My son's arm rash that turned out to be the typical bullseye indicative of lyme disease.][arm-bullseye]

We debated taking him to the doctor for about half an hour, and eventually decided to send a photo of his rash to two friends who happen to be a nurse and a doctor. Our doctor friend immediately confirmed that it looked suspicious enough that she thought we should get him checked out. By the time we got to the doctor's office that day, he had developed several obvious "bullseye" rashes all over his skin: Chest, back, arms, legs, and yes: that redness around his eyes was one too. The only reason we didn't catch any of these earlier was that he's capable enough now to dress himself and he didn't report them to us.

We are so fortunate to have caught it early. He was put on antibiotics immediately and the doctors believe that he will not suffer any lasting effects. (He has also since stopped complaining of soreness in his legs.) But what if we didn't know a doctor and a nurse? What if I made a few thousand dollars per year less and had less forgiving insurance as a result? I can easily imagine a life in which we would have waited another day or two before taking him in, and then the outcome could have been very different. And if I can imagine it so easily, there are undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of people living that life today.

That's my family's insurance. Mine is easier to deal with, but terrifying for the first few months of the year. I get what's called a "deductible-only" plan, which means that once I've met my deductble, all medical expenses are covered 100% for the rest of the year without any co-pays or co-insurance. (I still have to pay my premiums all year.) We also qualify for a medical expenses assistance program that will cover my medication up to $10,000 per year. So I pick a deductible-only plan with a deductible below $10,000 and schedule my first two treatments for as early as possible in the year, to try and meet my deductible as soon as I possibly can, so that I don't have to worry about medical problems for the rest of the year. I still have to pay for the administrative fees out of pocket until I reach my deductible, but those are very manageable when compared to the cost of the medicine. And until I've met my deductible, I have to be extra careful not to get hurt or sick, because all medical expenses are mine to pay 100%.

All of this is to say that we jump through several not-insignificant hoops for our medical insurance. It adds a lot of stress to our lives; and that's when things are running "well." At least as well as Aetna will let them.

## Insurance Frauds?

Cut to today. I received a phone call from my Rheumatologist's billing/insurance manager, letting me know that she has been in contact with Aetna several times over recent weeks and months to try and get them to pay their share of my first two treatments this year. Aetna continues to deny the request. As a result, **I will not be allowed to get my next infusion unless and until my expenses are paid.**

Aetna claims they need possibly as much as 60 business days to process the claim. It could be the end of August before they process the claim, and they could still deny it at that point. I don't have that much time.

<h2 id="countdown" align="center"></h2>
<script type="text/javascript">
	(function initializeClock(id, endtime){
		function getTimeRemaining(endtime){
			var t = Date.parse(endtime) - Date.parse(new Date());
			var seconds = Math.floor( (t/1000) % 60 );
			var minutes = Math.floor( (t/1000/60) % 60 );
			var hours = Math.floor( (t/(1000*60*60)) % 24 );
			var days = Math.floor( t/(1000*60*60*24) );

			return {
				'total': t,
				'days': days,
				'hours': hours,
				'minutes': minutes,
				'seconds': seconds
			};
		}

		var clock = document.getElementById(id);
		var timeinterval = setInterval(function(){
			var t = getTimeRemaining(endtime);
			t.hours = ('0' + t.hours).slice(-2)
			t.minutes = ('0' + t.minutes).slice(-2)
			t.seconds = ('0' + t.seconds).slice(-2);
			clock.innerHTML = t.days + ' days and ' + t.hours + ':' + t.minutes + ':' + t.seconds;
			if(t.total<=0){
				clearInterval(timeinterval);
			}
		},1000);
	})('countdown', 'July 5 2016 07:20:00 GMT-0400');
</script>

I can probably delay a treatment by as much as a week, two tops. I have once or twice in the  past for various important reasons, but in general we try to avoid it whenever possible. Here's what happens when I miss a treatment:

- Depending on several factors including how much exercise I've been getting (more is worse), the weather, and dumb luck, I could begin experiencing some soreness and inflamation in my lower back and hips a few days before a treatment is scheduled. Just writing this is making my hips start to ache. Yay psychosomaticism!

- **By three or four days after a missed treatment**, it is clear to me based on pain levels that I am due for an infusion.

- **By day seven** I am probably in near-constant, low grade pain. On the typical 1-10 range your doctor asks you to use, this would be a 3. I may have trouble sleeping.

- **By day ten** my pain will be a 4 or higher and I will definitely have trouble sleeping. I may need to start taking over-the-counter pain medication as frequently as allowed to be able to keep my mind off of the pain and concentrate on my work.

- **By day fourteen** even OTC pain medication may not help any more. I may not even want to get out of bed.

**It is also my understanding that it is possible to develop an allergy to Remicade if I am off of it for too long.** _I could become unable to receive the drug that makes it possible for me to live a normal life._ Because Aetna is too busy to handle a claim that was submitted in January (date of service: 2016-01-22) -- not to mention other claims for service provided on 4/12 and 5/24. But we'll get to that.

## History of interactions with Aetna

Not only did my doctor's office submit the proper paperwork immediately following service, as usual, but they also followed up by phone on April 7th, June 9th, June 27th, and June 28th. In April they were told the claim was denied,


- Untreated, my spine will fuse
- Possibly become allergic to the medicine that helps me
- What if I decided to stop paying my premiums?
