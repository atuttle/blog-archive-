[CFLint](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint) is making great progress on linting CFML, and they're pretty responsive to bug reports and pull requests too. Best of all, it's compatible with [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter) via [SublimeLinter-contrib-CFLint](https://github.com/ckaznocha/SublimeLinter-contrib-CFLint).

## Installing

- Install CFLint `mvn clean install -D assembleDirectory=/usr/local`
- Install SublimeLinter: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter
- https://github.com/ckaznocha/SublimeLinter-contrib-CFLint
- what else?
